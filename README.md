# KDAC
A general activation function termed KDAC for knowledge discovery

The positive region corresponds to an adaptive linear design encouraged by ReLU. The negative region considers the interaction between exponent and linearity to surmount the obstacle of gradient vanishing and no negative value. Crucially, the non-differentiable points are alerted and eliminated by a smooth approximation.

KDAC can achieve more superior performance on six datasets containing various knowledge, while it time complexity is large.
