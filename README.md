# KDAC
A general activation function termed KDAC for knowledge discovery

KDAC draws inspirations from linear Newton interpolation for nonlinear eigenvalue problem, and leverages an approximate smoothing algorithm to manage non-differentiable existence. Besides, KDAC absorbs Tanh form exponential structure and adjustable linear structure.

KDAC can achieve more superior performance on six datasets containing various knowledge.
